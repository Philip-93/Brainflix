## About

[Academic Project] - A mock SPA (single page application) site for streaming videos. Demonstrating proficiency in React, React-Router, Node, Express, API's as well as other front-end essentials.

## Goals and Requirements

My goal was to build a full stack single page application from the ground up. To accomplish this goal I used React, Express, and Node.js. Additionally, I also used an API to obtain the video data, stream URL as well as the default comments. I was able to include functionality in the upload section, however full functionality was not part of the project requirements. As for the styling, we were provided with a mock-up. I was expected to recreate a responsive app according to its specifications.

## Key Learnings

- Fully understood and implemented React fundamentals, including component lifecyle methods, using props and state as well as JSX.
- Utilized React-Router for declarative routing.
- Implemented the basics of Node.js and Express, created API endpoints in order to receive and return data.
- Used Semantic HTML, BEM methodoloy.
- Flexbox, SAAS, responsive and mobile-first design.
- Axios
